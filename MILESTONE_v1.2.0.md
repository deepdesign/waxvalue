### Key Code Changes:
1. **Conditional Rendering Logic:**
   ```tsx
   {/* Desktop Table */}
   {totalItems > 0 && (
     <div className="w-full overflow-x-auto hidden xl:block">
       {/* Table content */}
     </div>
   )}
   ```

2. **Empty State Icon:**
   ```tsx
   <DocumentMagnifyingGlassIcon className="mx-auto h-12 w-12 text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500" />
   ```

3. **Type Safety Improvements:**
   ```tsx
   const statusOrder: { [key: string]: number } = { 'underpriced': 0, 'overpriced': 1, 'fairly_priced': 2 }
   ```

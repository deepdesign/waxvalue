# Pre-Development Compliance Checklist

## MANDATORY: Review Before Every Code Change

This checklist must be completed before making ANY code changes to the WaxValue project.

### 1. Documentation Review ✅
- [x] Read and understand `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`
- [x] Check Tailwind CSS documentation: https://tailwindcss.com/docs
- [x] Review Discogs API documentation: https://www.discogs.com/developers
- [x] Verify `docs/iteration-checklist.md` requirements

### 2. Tailwind CSS Components Compliance
- [x] Use Tailwind's utility classes for tab implementations
- [x] Follow Tailwind's design system for consistent UI
- [x] Implement proper loading states and error handling
- [x] Ensure all components are responsive for desktop/tablet
- [x] Use Tailwind's built-in utility classes and design tokens
- [x] No custom implementations that duplicate Tailwind functionality

### 3. Discogs API Integration Compliance
- [x] Implement OAuth 1.0a flow correctly
- [x] Handle request token generation and authorization
- [x] Process verifier code exchange for access token
- [x] Store access tokens securely
- [x] Implement 60 requests per minute rate limiting
- [x] Add proper throttling and queue management
- [x] Handle rate limit exceeded responses gracefully
- [x] Implement exponential backoff for retries
- [x] Use correct Discogs API endpoints for inventory fetching
- [x] Handle API authentication failures appropriately

### 4. TypeScript & Security Compliance
- [x] Strict type checking enabled
- [x] No `any` types without justification
- [x] Proper interface definitions for API responses
- [x] Type-safe component props and state management
- [x] No API keys or secrets in client-side code
- [x] Proper environment variable handling
- [x] Secure token storage and transmission
- [x] Input validation and sanitization

### 5. Performance & Testing
- [x] Implement proper caching strategies
- [x] Optimize API calls with batching where possible
- [x] Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
- [x] Implement lazy loading for large datasets
- [ ] Unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Component tests for UI interactions

### 6. Current Project Status
- [x] Review existing TODO items and their priorities
- [x] Check for any ongoing development tasks
- [x] Verify current branch and commit status
- [x] Ensure no conflicts with existing implementations
